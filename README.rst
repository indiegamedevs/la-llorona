La Llorona
==========

La Llorona is a platform game we created for the `Spooky Game Jam Midwest 2020`_.

The build we submitted to the jam can be `played on Itch.io`_.  Unfortunately,
we ran out of time before we could implement player death, so La Llorona just
kind of chases you around.  There's also a few scenes in the repo that didn't
make it to the submission build.

The game is written in C# for the `Godot Engine`_. (We ♥ Open Source)
